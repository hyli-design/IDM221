## Document Inspiration
* [Nendo](https://www.nendo.jp/)
* [Kenya Hara ](https://www.ndc.co.jp/hara/en/)
* [Shenghung Lee](https://www.shenghunglee.com/)

On why I like these three sites.

Nendo and Kenya Hara are both designers and design studios that I really like, so they come with their own filters and every time I think about designers, these two sites are the first to come to my mind. As for the website design itself, it is simple and straightforward, without too many special effects and complicated operation processes, what comes to my eyes is the result of the designers.

I have to say one thing I don't like is that Kenya Hara's site takes too long to load, maybe because it has to load a lot of images, or the server is in Japan.

* About me

For me, the questions "why do you want to be a designer" and "what kind of designer do you want to be" have been asked many times by different people, and it was very painful at the beginning when I couldn't find the answer. So I started to try to think about this question from a different perspective --- what is design to me?

Looking back at the past ten years from a third perspective, I didn't choose to go to school to become a designer because design is a profession, but I realized that the definition of designer fits my thinking logic. When I was in junior high school, I wanted to become a fashion designer because I was dissatisfied with clothes, and then I wanted to become an interior designer because I was dissatisfied with home decoration. When the experience of using a product deviated from my expectation as a user, I would think about the reason for the deviation and the plan to improve or redesign it. This thought process will naturally take shape in my mind. After entering the product design profession, I learned that design is more of a mindset than a profession, and the empathy, define, ideation, prototype, and test mentioned in Design Thinking fit perfectly with my daily thinking patterns.

Regarding the motivation of design, I once wanted to be a fashion designer and an interior designer, but I gave up due to some internal and external reasons. The process of denying myself over and over again made me start to think about what is the motivation for me to become a designer, just a nice piece of clothing and jewelry? A building that fits my aesthetics? Is it just the visual stimulation? In a way, yes, but these are just the end result of my thinking process. Looking back at my whole thinking pattern what really appealed to me and drove me to start thinking was the pain point of the problem itself. The product interacts with the user, the problem is created during that interaction, and the trigger for the problem has a lot of appeal to me.
